# TANKS 6 (For Arduino)

## About
This project is a tank based game for teensy (atmega32u4) and screen (Nokia5110) on a board (unsure sorry) detailed in the TeensyLCD schematics (in resources). The game involves determining the correct angle and power (with wind intervening) necessary to destroy the enemy tank. But watch out the enemy tank fires back and is a quick learner, usually achieving a kill shot by by the third or fourth shot... Try your luck.
